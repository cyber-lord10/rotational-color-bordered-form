**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**

*   **`assets/css/app.css` Content:**  Make sure your CSS file is well-structured, commented, and uses CSS variables for easy customization.  Provide clear instructions on how to use those variables in the `README.md`.  Consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less if your CSS becomes complex.
*   **`home.html` Example:**  Creating a simple `home.html` file demonstrating how to use the rotational borders makes it much easier for others to understand and integrate your code.
*   **Live Demo:**  A live demo (using CodePen, CodeSandbox, or a simple deployed webpage) is crucial for showcasing your project.
*   **License File:** Choose a license (MIT is often a good default) and create a `LICENSE` file in the root of your repository with the full license text.  You can find license text templates online (e.g., search for "MIT License text").
*   **Git Repository:**  Create a GitHub (or GitLab, etc.) repository for your project and push all your files there.
*   **Concise & Clear:**  Keep the `README.md` concise and easy to understand.  Use clear language and provide examples.
*   **Keywords:** Add relevant keywords to your repository's description on GitHub to make it easier for people to find.
*   **Accessibility:**  Consider the accessibility of your design.  Ensure sufficient contrast between the borders and the content.
